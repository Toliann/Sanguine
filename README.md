# Tolian Moons (LLL)


1 new game moon 

# New Moon: Sanguine

>DESIGNATION: Sanguine

>RISK LEVEL: A

>POPULATION: Unknown

>CONDITIONS: A humid and thick forest sprawls across the whole continent. Seemingly abandoned structures can be found inside the forest, teeming with an unidentical energy.

>FAUNA: Diverse.

>HISTORY: Initial scans revealed a seemingly abandoned planet, yet the structures are well-maintained despite that. Technology have a habit of going haywire near these structures (especially GPSs), as such explorers seldom visit. The ones that do visit and survive the expeditions have become world famous, including but not limited to: Rachel, Melissa, and Samantha.

>ROUTING COST: 520
